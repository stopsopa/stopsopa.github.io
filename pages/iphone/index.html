          Guided Access:
            Settings -> Accessibility -> Guided Access
              make sure it's on
            Then got o any app and triple click power button AND WAIT A MOMENT
            then also check OPTIONS to turn off all

          to unlock triple click power button again

          TIP: if Face ID is enabled in the Accessability settings,
          then you can unlock by DOUBLE PRESS, it will immediately scan you face and unlock
          so if you hand phone over to someone sniky then probably turning this off is also needed
        </script>
        <h2>Turn off temporary Face ID</h2>
        <script type="editor" data-lang="python">

          and that will bring the power off screen.
          Exit it and from that moment you can unlock the phone only with passcode.
