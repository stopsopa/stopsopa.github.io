        <h2>Shortcuts</h2>

        <script type="editor" data-lang="python">

          ? - show shortcuts
          q - keep selected tool active after drawing
                button with the padlock in the top right corner
          h - panning tool
                no need to use space to move around canvas - easier exploring big drawings
          v - selection tool
                first tool in the tool pallete


                Send to back            Cmd + Option + [   (this sends to very back - this shortcut might not work in Obsidian - don't know why)
                Bring to front          Cmd + Option + ]   (this sends to very front - this shortcut might not work in Obsidian - don't know why)
                Send backward           Cmd + [            (sends just one z-index back)
                Bring forward           Cmd + ]            (sends just one z-index front)

          TIPS:
            - when some elements are selected by holding shift and cliking more we can add or remove individual elements from selection

          CMT + ' - toggle grid
