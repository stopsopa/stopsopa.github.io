          Well known issues:
              - First of all, weâ€™re deliberately violating the Single Responsibility Principle. The Person model class knows the validation rules for all the use cases it is validated for. The model class has to change if a validation specific to a certain use case changes.
              - hard to read
              - We've Always Done It This Way

              - testing is hard

          My issues with it:
              - limited flexibility
                  In the data validation domain quite often we will encounter the need to do validation of particular field differently based on the value in the other field.
                  Examples:
                      - If the person filling out the form is under a certain age (e.g., 18), then the "Parent/Guardian Consent" field may need to be required, meaning the person has to provide consent from their parent or guardian.

                      - If the person is above the age threshold (e.g., 18 or older), then the "Parent/Guardian Consent" field may become optional or even hidden, as it's no longer necessary.

                      apparently solution is CustomValidator but that will work only for simple cases
