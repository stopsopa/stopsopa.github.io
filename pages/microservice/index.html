          MICROSERVICES:

          PROS:
            - separation of responsibility.
            - faster deployment.
            - easier to onboard a virtually unlimited number of developers without blocking them.
            - ability to leverage the strengths of different languages or technologies in separate services,
                    each service optimized for specific tasks and connected to the rest of the services via API

          CONS:
            - hard to keep APIs consistent; changes are harder to communicate across teams,
              whereas in a monolith, it simply wouldn’t compile.
              - derrived problem: some changes will require multiple microservices to be deployed at the same time
            - internal data passing (by value or reference) turns into network traffic.
              (which will slow down the app and might not be cheap)
            - it’s much harder to achieve atomic operations -> logic will have tendency to stuck in broken state.
              - derived problem: usually it is harder to implement and test solutions for fixing broken states.
            - generally harder to debug and trace events.
            - long-term development probably will slow down as more time is spent debugging
              obscure errors and fixing broken states in every sprint.
            - harder to identify who is responsible for errors (teams might shift blame), leading to confusion.
            - much harder to maintain consistent coding styles, as different
              services may use different techniques or technologies.
            - more challenging to launch a local instance of all services.
            - harder to conduct real end-to-end testing and cleanup afterward.

          General Conclusion:
            Microservices are effective for certain problems,
            but it’s crucial to keep the number of microservices low — only use them when absolutely necessary.
            Might be initially beneficial to keep development velocity high but it brings a lot of challenges down the line.
            It's a tradeof as many things in programming.
