          margin account:
            - buy stock (cash account can do that too)
            - short stock
            - borrow money
            - margin calls

          SHORT STOCK (very risky) - Bearish
            When you short a stock, you are borrowing shares, which is why margin is required
            you need margin account (not available for mortals) which requires:
              - Margin accounts
              - Collateral              
              - Margin calls
                if trade goes against you:
                  A margin call happens when your account equity falls below the required level.
                    - The stock price rises
                    - Your losses grow                    
                    - Your collateral is no longer sufficient
                  What happens in a margin call
                    Your broker will demand that you:                    
                      - Deposit more cash OR                    
                      - Close part/all of the position
                    ⚠️ If you don’t act fast, the broker can force-close your trade at a loss — without asking you.
            Risks of margin & short selling:
              - Unlimited losses
              - Stock goes to $0 → max profit capped              
              - Stock goes up indefinitely → losses unlimited
              - Short squeezes (read more about this feedback loop)
              - Broker liquidates your position at the top
          BUY PUT OPTIONS:
            - risk limited/defined (loss of premium paid)
            - downside - time limit
            - cheaper
            - no margin call - just expiration
            - you need only Cash account
            Example: 
              Buy 1 put contract (100 shares):
                - Strike = $100                
                - Cost = $5 per share = $500 total                
                - Expiration = 2 months
              Outcomes
                If stock falls to $70                
                  - Put value ≈ $30                  
                  - Value = $3,000                  
                  - Profit = $2,500 ($3,000 − $500)                
                If stock rises to $150                
                  - Put expires worthless                
                  - Loss = $500 (max loss)
