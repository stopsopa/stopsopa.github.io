            # UTF-8 represents each Unicode character using a variable number of bytes.
            # For instance, it represents A with one byte, 65; it represents the Hebrew
            # character Aleph, which has code 1488 in Unicode, with the two-byte
            # sequence 215â€“144. UTF-8 represents all characters in the ASCII range
            # as in ASCII, that is, with a single byte smaller than 128.
            # It represents all other characters using sequences of bytes where the first
            # byte is in the range [194,244] and the continuation bytes are in the
            # range [128,191]. More specifically, the range of the starting bytes
            # for two-byte sequences is [194,223]; for three-byte sequences, the range
            # is [224,239]; and for four-byte sequences, it is [240,244].
            # None of those ranges overlap. This property ensures that the code sequence
            # of any character never appears as part of the code sequence of any other
            # character. In particular, a byte smaller than 128 never appears in a
            # multibyte sequence; it always represents its corresponding ASCII character.
