@index.html

I need small page everything should be in this index.html file

in it load using fetch file @list.txt

the page should be divided inth two halfs

on each half I should be able to choose from any links from @list.txt

and then after selecting given file will be loaded to some kind of view under the selector

the same on left and right

then once on each side the file is selected then we should load these two files and show the diff of these two

ideally side by side

so basically it should be like

selector | selector
view | view

where we should see in view & view what has changed between these two files

for testing assume server is running and you can load
