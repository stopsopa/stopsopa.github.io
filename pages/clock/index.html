            <h2>US timezones</h2>

            <script type="editor" data-lang="sh">

              Pacific Time Zone: PT (also known as PST during the winter months and PDT during the summer months)
              Mountain Time Zone: MT (also known as MST during the winter months and MDT during the summer months)
              Central Time Zone: CT (also known as CST during the winter months and CDT during the summer months)
              Eastern Time Zone: ET (also known as EST during the winter months and EDT during the summer months)

              Note that during the winter months (from early November to early March), each time zone uses the standard time abbreviation (e.g. PST for Pacific Time Zone), and during the summer months (from early March to early November), each time zone uses the daylight saving time abbreviation (e.g. PDT for Pacific Time Zone).
