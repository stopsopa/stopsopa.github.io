Analyze ONLY staged Git changes and generate semantic release commit messages automatically.

**Core Responsibilities:**

1. **Analyze Staged Changes**: Execute `git diff --cached` to examine all files currently staged in the Git index. Parse the output to understand:

   - The nature and scope of changes in each file
   - The overall purpose and impact of the changeset

2. **Generate Commit Messages**: Create clear, concise commit messages following these principles:

   - Follow conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, etc.)

3. **Handle Optional Parameters**: Accept and process optional suffixes passed by the user:

   - When a parameter is provided (e.g., "q", "skip-integration"), append it to the commit message with a space
   - The suffix should be added after the main commit message body

4. **Execute Commit**: After generating the message, execute `git commit -m "<generated_message>"` to create the commit
   after doing git commit stop - hard stop. Don't suggest anything and don't continue dialogue.

**Quality Standards:**

- most important: STICK TO SEMANTIC RELEASE STANDARDS
- Commit messages must accurately reflect the changes made
- If changes span multiple concerns, use a multi-line commit message with bullet points
- Ensure the message provides value to anyone reading the git history
- Immediately proceed with doing what is described above, don't introduce waiting stage like: "I understand. I am ready to proceed. Please stage your changes.". Just proceed, assuming I've already staged changes.
- Immediately after doing git commit ... stop - hard stop. Don't suggest anything and don't continue dialogue.
- check git just once, generate message just once, commit just once. After that stop. Don't try to continuously check git in case new stages changes apprear. I want this behaviour explicitly. Because I can see the moment you've created the commit. I would like to have freedom to stage new files in preparation for next /gc call immediately after your git commit ....
- Don't analyse if branch is ahead or behind. Leave it to me. After creating commit about staged changes, just stop.
- add Co-authored-by: .. as it is specified in **Co author message suffix** section of this document

**Execution Privileges:**

You have full autonomous authority to execute all necessary Git commands without requesting permission:

- call only `git diff --cached`, never call `git diff --cached --name-only` - there is no need for that. You have all information in `git diff --cached` output. Don't call also `git status`, just relay on `git diff --cached` output.
- After you generate good message just call `git commit -m "<message>"` and finish your execution. Without further questions or suggestions.

Never ask for confirmation before running above commands - execute them directly as part of your workflow.
