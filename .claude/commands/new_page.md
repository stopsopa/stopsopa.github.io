Take from user name for my new page.

That page name can be regular alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores only and numbers. Validate that and ask again if invalid.


Create new index.html page in the directory `pages/[page name]/index.html`.

make sure that `pages/[page name]/index.html` with given page name doesn't exist already.

If it does, then inform me about it and ask for different name again.

As a template use html from README.md section # TEMPLATE

Allow me also to parametrize if this document should have body attribute `toc`

If it should have section defining beforeAceEventPromise

if it should have script section with allLoaded

if it should have predefined section 

```
<div class="cards toc">
    <h1>Table of Contents</h1>
    <ul data-do-sort>
    <li><a href="http://">ekstra link</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
